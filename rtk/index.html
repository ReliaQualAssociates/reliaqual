        					<h1>Features</h1>
        					<p>RTK is available for Linux 
        					<img src="../images/linux.png" width="22" height="22" alt=""> and 
        					Windows <img src="../images/windows.png" width="22" height="22" alt="">.</p>
        					
        					<p>There is no such things as a "one-size fits all" reliability program or process.  
        					Every organization needs to have a process that fits best with their corporate 
        					culture and their industry.  However, there are certain methods and analyses 
        					common to all successful reliability programs.  RTK supports many of these 
        					popular analyses and more functionality is added with every release.  Many 
        					existing RTK features are discussed on this page or can be seen in the RTK 
        					<a href="http://www.reliaqual.com/images/screenshots/index.php/RTK">
        					screenshot</a> gallery.</p>  

							<p>RTK is layed out in three windows.  Each of these windows is referred to as a 
							book.  There is a Module Book, a Work Book, and a List Book.  The Module Book
							allows the selection of one of the nine RTK modules.  Lists and matrices associated
							with the selected module are found in the List Book.  The attributes of the selected
							item in the Module Book can be viewed and edited in the Work Book.  This 
							<a href="http://www.reliaqual.com/images/screenshots/var/albums/RTK/RTKLayout.png?m=1410709971">
							screenshot</a> shows the layout of these three books before loading a program 
							database.</p>

        					<h3>Modularity</h3>
        					<p>As mentioned above, RTK consists of modules.  A module represents a 
        					characteristic of a system or an aspect of the development program.  Each 
        					module provides a different view of the system under development.  RTK consists 
        					of nine modules.  These nine modules are:</p>
        					<ul>
        						<li>Revision</li>
        						<li>Function</li>
        						<li>Requirement</li>
        						<li>Hardware</li>
        						<li>Software</li>
        						<li>Verification & Validation</li>
        						<li>Program Incidents</li>
        						<li>Reliability Testing</li>
        						<li>Survival Analysis</li>
        					</ul>
        					<p>Modules are accessed via the RTK Module Book.  These modules are 
        					discussed in greater detail in the side pane.</p>
      					</div>
      				</div>
      				
      				<div class="row">
      					<div class="span8">
        					<h3>Attributes</h3>
        					<p>Each RTK module has various attributes.  The number of attributes, as well as 
        					the content of each attribute, varies with each RTK module.  Attributes can be 
        					anything from the name of a revision, the failure rate of a hardware assembly, or 
        					the failure mode of a function.</p>
          					<p>Attributes are primarily accessed through the RTK Work Book.</p>
      					</div>
      				</div>

					<div class="row">
      					<div class="span8">
        					<h3>Navigation</h3>
        					<p>There are two methods for navigating through the various modules in RTK.  
        					The first method, or the "classical" method, is to select the module to work with in 
        					the Module Book.  With the module you wish to work with selected in the Module 
        					Book, you would select the proper page in the Work Book for the analysis you wish 
        					to perform.</p>
        					
        				   	<p>The second method of navigating RTK is through the use of a process map.  
        			   		With the process map, a mouse click will take you to the proper module in the
        			   		Module Book and the appropriate page in the Work Book to perform the analysis.  
        			   		For example, if your reliability process includes a step to gather stakeholder inputs 
        			   		(i.e., Voice of the Customer), clicking on this step in the process map will select 
        			   		the Revision module in the Module Book and the first page in the Work Book.</p>
        			   		 
        			    	<p>This screenshot shows RTK being navigated via the process map.  However,
        			    	because no two organizations have exactly the same reliability process, ReliaQual 
        			    	Associates will work with your team to accurately define your process and then 
        			    	create the navigable process map.</p>

      				</div>

      					<div class="span8">
        					<h3>Customization</h3>
        					<p>Many aspects of RTK are user-configurable.  Users have some control over the 
        					look and feel of the user interface such as the position of the tabs in the 
        					various notebooks.  The column headings in the various spreadsheet-type views can 
        					be set by the user if the default headings don't meet their needs.  For example, 
        					the column headings in the FMEA use typical MIL-STD-1629A or automotive terminology.  
        					These headings can be changed by the user to reflect the terminology used by their
        					organization.  Items in many of the drop down lists can be deleted, edited, or
        					appended by users with administrator credentials.</p>
        					
        			   		<p>Customization beyond this can be performed by ReliaQual Associates, LLC.  
        			   		Just <a href="https://reliaqual.wufoo.com/forms/qoutc9f09v1qf7">contact</a> 
        			   		us with your customization needs and we'll provide a proposal.</p>

      			 <h2>The RTK Modules</h2>      				
      			<div class="design span4 concept">
        			<h3>Revision</h3>
        			<p>The Revision module is used to document and analyze different revisions or 
        			configurations of a system.  For example, a revision could be a model year, a 
        			change to an existing system, or a configuration that includes optional 
        			features.</p>
					<p><a class="btn btn-mini pull-left" href="http://www.reliaqual.com/images/screenshots/index.php/RTK/Revision">Screenshots</a></p>
      			</div>

      			<div class="design span4 concept">
        			<h3>Function</h3>
        			<p>The Function module documents and analyzes the functions of a system.  
        			Functional analysis is important during conceptual design before hardware details 
        			are defined.  As the development program progresses and hardware becomes 
        			defined, the Function module allows the relationships between hardware 
        			assemblies and functions to be visualized.</p>
          			<p><a class="btn btn-mini pull-left" href="http://www.reliaqual.com/images/screenshots/index.php/RTK/Function">Screenshots</a></p>
      			</div>
    
      			<div class="design span4 concept">
        			<h3>Requirements</h3>
        			<p>Requirements for a configuration are documented and analyzed in the 
        			Requirements module.  Documentation of a revision's requirements begins with 
        			the elicitation of stakeholder inputs.  Once stakeholder inputs are captured, 
        			requirements can be developed and written in engineering terminology.  These 
        			requirements can then be analyzed for clarity, completeness, consistency, and 
        			verifiability.  Finally, those tasks that will be used to validate the design 
        			can be linked to each requirement.</p>

      			<div class="design span4 concept">
        			<h3>Hardware</h3>
        			<p>Analysis of the system hardware is performed in the Hardware module.  
        			Available analyses include reliability allocations, hazards analysis, similar item 
        			analysis,handbook reliability predictions, and FMEA.  The FMEA supports 
        			MIL-STD-1629A and automotive style (RPN) criticality analysis.</p>

	      		<div class="design span4 concept">
   	     			<h3>Software</h3>
      	  			<p>System software is analyzed to determine program risk for each Software 
      	  			module.  Risk is determined by considering the development organization, methods 
      	  			used, documentation of requirements, and tools and test techniques used to 
      	  			develop the software.</p>

				<div class="design span4 concept">
        			<h3>Verification & Validation</h3>
        			<p>Verification and validation tasks are those analyses and tests used to verify 
        			and validate the design satisfies program requirements.  These tasks can be linked 
        			to the requirement to be verified and validated in the Requirements module.  
        			Within the Verification & Validation module, the overall progress of the validation 
        			program is tracked.</p>

      			<div class="design span4 concept">
        			<h3>Reliability Testing</h3>
        			<p>Testing is an important aspect of a development program.  In the Testing 
        			module, various reliability tests can be planned, tracked, and the results assessed.  
        			Currently RTK supports reliability growth, reliability demonstration/qualification, and 
        			environmental stress screening (ESS) testing.</p>

      			<div class="design span4 concept">
        			<h3>Program Incidents</h3>
        			<p>Regardless of how well a development program proactively addresses 
        			reliability, there will always be problems.  While ReliaQual Associates recommends 
        			a dedicated FRACA application, RTK provides a minimal FRACA system with the 
        			Incidents module.  The intent of the Incidents module is to provide the Reliability 
        			Engineer a view of problems that often are not be available in non-FRACA 
        			production systems that capture failure information.  Computerized maintenance 
        			management systems (CMMS) are one example.  Additionally, the Incident 
        			module allows the engineer to add information to a failure record that may not be 
        			germane to the production system's purpose, but is critical from a reliability 
        			perspective.</p>

      			<div class="design span4 concept">
        			<h3>Survival Analysis</h3>
        			<p>Estimating the reliability of a system under development can be 
        			accomplished in several ways.  Field and test data from an earlier version, different 
        			configuration, or similar system adjusted as necessary for the new system 
        			generally provides a more accurate estimate than handbook prediction methods.  
        			After fielding a system, it is important to track the field reliability and adjust 
        			maintenance policies or make design changes as needed to address problems or 
        			trends.  The Survival Analysis module gives the Reliability Engineer the ability to 
        			analyze field and test failure data to estimate reliability metrics such as failure 
        			rates, MTBF, and reliability.  RTK's Survival Analysis module supports analytical 
        			methods appropriate for repairable and non-repairable items.</p>
